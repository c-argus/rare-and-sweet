        f'The accuracy metrics demonstrate a consistent upward trajectory, reflecting the modelâ€™s improved ability to differentiate between healthy leaves and those affected by powdery mildew over time. '
        f'Although the accuracy lines for training and validation sets are not exactly aligned, they remain closely associated throughout the training process, with only minor deviations.\n\n'
        f'Additionally, the loss metrics show a steady decline, indicating that the model is progressively reducing errors. '
        f'The loss lines for both the training and validation datasets closely follow one another, especially in the later stages of training, where they converge, suggesting minimal differences between the datasets.\n\n'
