        f'the validation and test datasets. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using various metrics, including '
        f'accuracy, loss, confusion matrices, and classification reports. The results indicate that the model is highly '
        f'effective in distinguishing between healthy and infected leaves, confirming the hypothesis.'
